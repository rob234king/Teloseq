Exploration of using telomere reads from Oxford Nanopore Technologies

The test reference available would need verifying. I took similarity from alignment to chm13 to get chr names as the HG002 naming seemed incorrect based upon similarity to chm13 subtelomeres. So worth checking that is corrrect or use your own reference chr arms.
